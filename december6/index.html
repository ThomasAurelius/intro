      <p>I was looking over half a dozen options for learning and updating my Web Development skills. None of them seemed to hit all my requirements. So, I decided to self-teach, using whatever online resources I can access for free, or nominal fees. This site is my evolving test playground, but also a way to document my journey, so I can share this experience. Maybe it helps someone who comes after me decide how they approach their own journey.</p>

       <h3>Resource Reviews</h3>
          <p></p>
                       
          <p>As of December 1st, I am 14 working days in now. For the below, I plan to update my current usage and opinions on what I interact with. </p>

                   
            <h3><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/ThomasAurelius">CodecademyPro</a></h3>
             <ul>
               <li><span class="bold">Current Opinion: </span>My current main learning platform. Good content in the Pro subscription.</li>
               <li><span class="bold">Value: </span>Still high. As of now, I plan to keep it through the end of Jan.</li>
               <li><span class="bold">Competition: </span>LinkedIn Learning. LIL offers all of its lessons via video. They do have supplemental files and excercises you can follow along with. But, for me, who has such a wide array of access points, it's difficult to keep current on the exercise every where I go. But, the videos are very high quality, with knowledgable experts that are excellent presenters. I listen to the videos, more than I watch and follow along. However, this page, is modified from on of their supplemental files in their CSS courses.</li>
               <li><span class="bold">Major Pros: </span>The in-browser follow along environment.</li>
               <li><span class="bold">Major Cons: </span>Nothing major, however, sometimes the validation of the in-browser developer, is finicky. Sometimes the lesson has the input wrong, or the validation wants an extra set of quotes, or someting all lower case, when the lesson has it capitalized, etc. Not a show stopper, but sometimes annoying.</developer></li>
             </ul>
    
           <h3><a href="https://codeanywhere.com">Codeanywhere</a></h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Current Opinion: </span>I still like it. Has a few issues with one of the older browsers I access, but not holding that against them.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Value: </span>For my situation, I still think its a good deal. I access from a number of PCs, tablets and even my phone.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Competition: </span>To be honest, I haven't looked.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Pros: </span>Accessibility.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Cons: </span>I struggle with keeping indentation correct. It tries to help... but for me, usually ends up making it worse. I've turned all of the auto functions off, and its better.</li>
            </ul>

              <li><span class="bold">Current Opinion: </span>Excellent content and instructors. I do like codecademy's in browser follow along better.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Value: </span>I plan to keep it after the trial, on a monthly basis. I figure I have a couple months worth of use still in it, but not a whole year.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Competition: </span>The only competitor I've looked at is CodecademyPro, above. There are local bootcamps that host free workshops about once a month, but I haven't gone to any yet.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Pros: </span>Video content can be downloaded for later(still have to be a paying member to play them). Quality instruction. Mostly relevant. I did catch a few references to things that have changed, but they were in an overview module, not a specific language.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Cons: </span>The supplemental files are great if you always work from one computer. This is not the case for me, but I still like the video content.</li>

              <li><span class="bold">Current Opinion: </span>I'll be honest, I struggled to understand how to use it for a day or two. But, I now have this project backed up there, and split out monthly branches for historical views.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Value: </span>Great for a free resource. I'd recommend to anyone working a project. </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Competition: </span>I haven't looked into any.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Pros: </span>Version control. And community support.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Major Cons: </span>A little tough to grasp their lingo and functionality. I understood the concept just fine, but the execution was a little challenging at first.</li>

      <!--   <h3>November 2018</h3>
            <p></p>
                       
            <p>Starting off, after over a decade away, I am taking a very DIY and low budget approach to this. 10k+ is way too much for a bootcamp IMO, so I'm determined to get there through mostly free resources. I plan to document and share my path, in the event anyone coming after me wants to do the same.
            <h3>Key resources:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">CodecademyPro.</span> Monthly. $19.99/mo. I liked it's format, and it runs (mostly) on some older OS's I use, when I have downtime.</li>>
              <li><span class="bold">Codeanywhere.</span> I didn't do too much research into IDE's before I chose this. Again, picked it because it works on all my devices.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">LinkedIn Learning Premium.</span> Free Month Trial. I like the content so far, running concurrent with codecademy, its covering the same material, just in another flavor. I usually hate video content, but I mostly just listen to the videos while commuting.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Github.</span> I signed up. Don't have much of a use yet. More on this later.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Skillcrush.</span> Ok, mostly this page to give me a roadmap. <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2017/03/20/front-end-developer-skills/">Skillcrush Road Map</a></li>
